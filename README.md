# A 2ohm dummy load with 300W power handling

This started as a bit of a joke at audiosciencereview.com, but turned out to work quite well - see thread (https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/silly-surface-mount-dummy-load-module.58077/).

Instead of using large wire wound resistors for dummy loads for amplifier testing, why not use cheap SMD resistors and boards?  This is the result.  a 1.97ohm board.  Yes that's a bit lower than 2 in oder to allow for other losses
